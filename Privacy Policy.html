The information we may collect via the Application depends on the content and materials you use. We do not personally store any of your information or any data about you. However, for the application to function, some data about you, your device, or your location may be necessary to collect. This information may be collected and transmitted by the application to other third party companies.

However, this app features paid in-app upgrades which allow you to pay an extra fee to unlock additional features in the application. These payments are handled by a third party library (API) in the app and you submit your payment information directly to them. All financial information is collected and stored by our payment processors, Google Play and Apple iTunes, and you are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions. Their privacy policies may be found at the following locations:</p><p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 25px; word-break: break-word !important;">https://policies.google.com/privacy</p><p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 25px; word-break: break-word !important;">https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/</p><p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 25px; word-break: break-word !important;"><br style="box-sizing: border-box;"/></p><p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 25px; word-break: break-word !important;">YOUR PHOTOS</p><p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 25px; word-break: break-word !important;">This app allows you to upload your photos to a colorization server which processes your black and white photos into color photos, and then returns them to your device. While this process is happening, your photos are temporarily stored on the colorization server so that they may be processed. These photos are transmitted to Algorithmia.com via the Colorful Image Colorization API. Your photos may stay on the colorization server for up to several days before they are automatically deleted, and may or may not be seen by human eyes of the developers who maintain the API in an effort to improve their algorithms. We implore you to never upload any photos that are private and that you do not want anyone to see. It is also your responsibility to never upload any photos that may be illegal in any country. If you upload any photos which are illegal, and they are found, the authorities may be contacted to investigate as required by law. Please do not use this service for any illegal means. Because the entire purpose of this app is to submit photos for colorization, we cannot give you a way to opt out of this under the GDPR regulations that are effective as of 5/25/2018.
